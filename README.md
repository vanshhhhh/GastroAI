GastroAI is an AI-powered platform for the automatic detection and recognition of gastrointestinal diseases. The platform uses a dataset of medical images from inside the gastrointestinal tract, which has been sorted and annotated by experienced endoscopists. The dataset, called Kvasir, contains images of three important anatomical landmarks and three clinically significant findings, as well as two categories of images related to endoscopic polyp removal.

The platform is designed to assist medical professionals in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases affecting the digestive system. It provides an objective and automated scoring system that can help to reduce inequalities, improve quality, and optimize the use of scarce medical resources. It also has the potential to increase the efficiency of doctors by reducing the time required for paperwork and increasing time for patient care.

# Features
- Automated detection and recognition of gastrointestinal diseases
- Objectively and accurately scores severity and sub-classification of different findings
- Supports automatic report generation and improved patient follow-up and treatment
- Uses a standardized dataset of medical images from inside the gastrointestinal tract, sorted and annotated by experienced endoscopists
- Provides a cutting-edge solution for the detection and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases
# Dataset
The Kvasir dataset is an important resource for research on both single- and multi-disease computer-aided detection. It contains a collection of images classified into three important anatomical landmarks and three clinically significant findings, as well as two categories of images related to endoscopic polyp removal. The dataset was sorted and annotated by experienced endoscopists, making it a valuable tool for medical research.

# Installation
